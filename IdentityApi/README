This extension is experimental. It should not be used by anyone in a production environment.

The purpose of this extension is to act as a sort of identity helper for other non-MediaWiki services that might be
run in the same hosting environment. An example might be a chat server, where it is desirable that users have the same
user name on the chat as they do on the wiki (and that users cannot impersonate one another).

This implementation is based on Wikia's Chat module AJAX functions[1], but tries to be more general.
