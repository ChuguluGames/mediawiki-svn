You will need node.js
See a basic guide at http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Hashar/cli-js

To test your setup you can use the dumb suite:

$ cd tests/qunit
$ node dumb-launch.js
[OK][dumb-code.js: Really basic example] looks fine
[OK][dumb-code.js: Really basic example] Variable assignement works

Files: 1
Tests: 1
Assertions: 2
Successes: 2
Errors: 0

Time: 124 ms

{ files: 1,
  tests: 1,
  assertions: 2,
  errors: 0,
  success: 2,
  time: 124 }
$

Works! :)
