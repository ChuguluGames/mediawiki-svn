To run this test suite from the commande line, you will need node.js.
See a basic guide about installing it at:
 http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Hashar/cli-js

The following node.js modules are also required and should be installed globally
with npm (Node Package Manager):
 - jquery
 - jsdom
 - qunit

To install them globally:
  sudo npm -g install jquery jsdom qunit

Make sure you have a NODE_PATH environnement variable or set it up with
the correct path. For example:
  export NODE_PATH="/opt/local/lib/node_modules"


To test your setup you can use the dumb suite:

$ cd tests/qunit
$ make dumb
[OK][dumb-code.js: Really basic example] looks fine
[OK][dumb-code.js: Really basic example] Variable assignement works

Files: 1
Tests: 1
Assertions: 2
Successes: 2
Errors: 0

Time: 124 ms

{ files: 1,
  tests: 1,
  assertions: 2,
  errors: 0,
  success: 2,
  time: 124 }
$

Works! :)

Now try out the MediaWiki test suite: make test
